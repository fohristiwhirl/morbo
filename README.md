# morbo

Work in progress. Chess engine match runner.

To use:

* Enter the directory and run `electron .`
* Select a config file from the Match menu (an example is provided, it will need editing).
* Sit back and watch...

Results are saved into the config file (I dunno if this is a good idea...) and a specified PGN is appended to.
